        I've spent the better part of the last 3 years trying to perfect my
        craft as a angler. My focus has spanned sight fishing warm/ salt
        water species with giant streamers to chunking tiny nymphs on tenkara
        set ups all across the South East Region.

        Music has been a focal point of my attention for the better part of
        last 5 years now, I'm still not very good, but it's enjoyable learning
        new things.

        For as long as I've had a phone with a camera I've been fascinated by
        trying to capture the beauty of the moment with it. Whether outdoors,
        with friends, or simple random moments in day to day life.
